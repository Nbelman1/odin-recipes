    <h1 class="green-bg">Best Soft Christmas Cookies</h1>
    <h2 class="brown-bg">Prepare For Awesomeness</h2>
        <p class="green-text bold">A Christmas cookie recipe for soft sugar cutouts that I have used for years. I sprinkle the cookies 
            with colored sugar before baking; you can also frost them with icing when cool.
            Here is a story about how my family has made these for decades from the recipe of my ancient grandmother
            who fought in the War of 1800s. This has no significance to the recipe whatsoever, but it helps me with SEO.</p>

    <h2 class="brown-bg">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="green-text">All-purpose flour</li>
        <li class="green-text">Baking powder</li>
        <li class="green-text">Salt</li>
        <li class="green-text">Sugar</li>
        <li class="green-text">Margarine</li>
        <li class="green-text">2 eggs</li>
        <li class="green-text">2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="brown-bg">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="green-text">Mix the ingredients in one bowl. Duh.</li>
        <li class="green-text">Beat the margarine and sugar in another bowl, then beat in the eggs and vanilla. <strong>POW</strong></li>
        <li class="green-text">Chill the dough in the fridge, then chill yourself out as well. It's going to be okay.</li>
        <li class="green-text">(Autobots) roll out the dough and cut into desired shapes.</li>
        <li class="green-text">Bake the cookies on prepared baking sheets until the edges are golden. No timer necessary here folks.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="brown-bg">Post-script</h2>
        <p class="green-text bold">Now that you've read the whole story behind what makes these cookies special, here's the actual recipe. 
            This has nothing to do with my SEO performance, I promise. Also, the links to the ingredients totally do not earn
            us a commission. THANK$</p>
